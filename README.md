# JSCS Linter

> JSCS â€” JavaScript Code Style is a code style checker. You can configure jscs
>for your project in detail using over 60 validation rules. See
>[mdevils/node-jscs](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs) for more
>information about JSCS.

This package will lint your `.js` and `.jsx` opened filed in Atom through
[jscs linter](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs).
**It will lint on edit and/or on save**, so you'll see instantly if your code
is following your code conventions/style.

*   Support `.jscs.json`, `.jscsrc` and `package.json` configurations files
*   Switch between `jscs` presets with ease.
*   Enable `esnext` for babel ES6/ES7/JSX syntax support.
*   Can autofix your file to the codestyle.

(Install [React package](https://atom.io/packages/react) to have `.jsx` files
syntax recognized, and possibly linted by the linter)

A gif is better than everything:

problems).
